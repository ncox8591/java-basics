### Exercise 3.27 (Geometry: points in triangle?) Suppose a right triangle is placed in a plane as shown below. The right-angle point is placed at (0, 0), and the other two points are placed at (200, 0) and (0, 100). Write a program that prompts the user to enter a point with x- and y-coordinates and determines whether the point is inside the triangle. Here are the sample runs:

    Enter a point's x- and y- coordinates: 100.5 25.5
    The point is in the triangle
