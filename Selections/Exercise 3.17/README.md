### Exercise 3.17 (Game: scissor, rock, paper) Write a program that plays the popular scissor-rock-paper game. The program randomly generates a number 0, 1, or 2 representing scissor, rock, and paper. The program prompts the user to enter a number 0, 1, or 2 and displays a message indicating whether the user or computer wins, loses, or draws. Here are sample runs:

    scissor (0), rock (1), paper (2): 1
    The computer is scissor. You are rock. You won.
    
    scissor (0), rock (1), paper (2): 1
    The computer is paper. You are paper too. It is a draw.
