### Exercise 2.21 (Financial application: calculate future investment value) Write a program that reads in investment amount, annual interest rate, and number of years and displays the future investment value using the following formula:
                         futureInvestmentValue =
    investmentAmount x (1 + monthlyInterestRate)^(numberOfYears * 12)
For example, if you enter amount 1000, annual interest rate 3.25% and number of years 1, the future investment is 1032.98
