### Exercise 2.15 (Geometry: distance of two points) Write a program that prompts the user to enter two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and displays their distance. The formula for computing the distance is 
### √((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2). Note you can use Math.pow(a, 0.5) to compute √(a). Here is a sample run:

    Enter x1 and y1: 1.5 -3.4
    Enter x2 and y2: 4    5
    The distance between the two points is 8.764131445842194
