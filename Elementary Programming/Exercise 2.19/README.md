### Exercise 2.19 (Geometry: area of a triangle) Write a program that prompts the user to enter three points (x1, y1) (x2, y2) (x3 y3) of a triangle then displays its area. The formula for computing the area of a triangle is

    s = (side1 + side2 + side3) / 2;
    
    area = âˆš(s(s - side1)(s - side2)(s - side3)
Here is a sample run,

    Enter the coordinates of three points separated by spaces
    like x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3: 1.5 -3.4 4.6 5 9.5 -3.4
    The area of the triangle is 33.6
