## Chapter 5: Loops
###### Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures by Y. Daniel Liang
### Key Notes
###### 3 types of repetition statements: while loop, do-while loop, and for loop. The part of the loop that contains the statements to be repeated is the loop body. An infinite loop is a loop statement that executes infinitely.
###### The while loop checks the loop-continuation-condition first. If the condition is true, the loop body is executed; if it is false, the loop terminates. It is a pre-test loop. It is used when the number of repetitions is not predetermined.
###### The do-while loop executes the loop body first then checks the loop-continuation-condition. It is a post-test loop. Use when the number of repetitions is not predetermined.
###### A sentinel value is a special value that signifies the end of the loop.
###### The for loop executes a loop body a fixed number of times. It has three parts: the first part is an initial action that often initializes a control variable; the second part, the loop-continuation-condition, determines whether the loop body is to be executed; and the third part is executed after each iteration (often to adjust the control variable). Usually the loop control variables are initialized and changed in the control structure. This is a pretest loop.
###### The keyword break immediately ends the innermost loop, which contains the break.
###### The keyword continue ends the current iteration.
