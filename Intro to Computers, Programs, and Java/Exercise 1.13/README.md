### Exercise 1.13 (Algebra: solve 2 x 2 linear equations) You can use Cramer's rule to solve the following 2 x 2 system of linear equation provided that ad - bc is not 0.

    ax + by = e             ed - bf            af - ec
                    x  = ------------   y =  ------------
    cx + dy = f             ad - bc            ad - bc
    
Write a program that solves the following equation and displays the value for x and y. (*Hint*: replace the symbols in the formula with numbers to compute x and y This exercise can be done in Chapter 1 without using materials in later chapters.)
