## Chapter 1: Introduction to Computers, Programs, and Java
###### Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures by Y. Daniel Liang
### Key Notes
##### I. What is a Computer? 
###### A computer is an electronic device that stores and processes data. It includes both hardware and software. A computer's CPU is its brain. The CPU receives instructions from memory and executes them. While computer hardware is physical, computer software is invisible. The operating system (OS) is a program that manages and controls a computer's activities. Computer programs are invisible instructions that control the hardware to perform tasks. Memory stores data and program instructions for the CPU to execute. Memory is volatile: information is lost when the power is turned off; however, programs and data are permanently stored on storage devices and are moved to memory when the computer actually uses them. A memory unit is a sequence of bytes, which is a sequence of 8 bits, which is a binary digit 0 or 1. Computers use zeros and ones because digital devices have two stable states (referred to by convention as zero or one). Think of a light switch: it has an off state (0), and an on state (1).
##### II. Programming
###### Computer programs are instructions that control hardware and make it perform tasks. Along with data they are permanently stored on a storage device and moved to memory when the computer uses them.
###### Machine language is a set of primitive instructions built into every computer.
###### Assembly language is a low-level programming language in which a mnemonic is used to represent each machine-language instruction.
###### High-level languages are English-like and easy to learn and program. A program written in high-level language is called a source program.
###### Compilers are software programs that translate source programs into a machine-language program.
###### Programming errors can be categorized as either syntax errors (reported by compiler), runtime errors (cause a program to terminate abnormally), and logic errors (unintended performance by the program).
##### III. Intro to Java
###### Java is platform independent: Java programs can be run on any computer.
###### The Java source file name must match the public class name in the program, and the source-code files must end with .java extension.
###### Every class is compiled into a separate bytecode file that has the same name as the class and ends with the .class extension.
###### Java source-code can be compiled from the command line with the javac command. To run a Java class from the command line, use the java command.
###### Keywords are reserved words that have specific meaning to the compiler and cannot be used for other purposes in the program.
###### The keyword class introduces a class definition, and its contents are included in a block beginning with an opening brace ({) and ending with a closing brace (}). Every Java program is a set of class definitions.
###### Methods are contained within a class. Java programs must have a main method to run. It is the entry point where the program starts when it's executed.
###### Comments are ignored by the compiler and denoted with two slashes (//) for a line comment or between '/*' and '*/' for block comments.
###### Java source programs are case sensitive, and every statement in Java ends with the statement terminator: a semi-colon (;)
