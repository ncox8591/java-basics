### Exercise 4.6 (Random points on a circle) Write a program that generates three random points on a circle centered at (0, 0) with radius 40 and displays three angles in a triangle formed by these three points, as shown in Figure 4.4a (*Hint*: Generate a random angle α in radians between 0 and 2π, as shown in Figure 4.4b and the point determined by this angle is (rˣcos(α), rˣsin(α)).)
