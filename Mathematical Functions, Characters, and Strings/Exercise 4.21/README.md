### Exercise 4.21 (Check SSN) Write a program that prompts the user to enter a Social Security number in the format DDD-DD-DDDD, where D is a digit. Your program should check whether the input is valid. Here are sample runs:

    Enter a SSN: 232-23-5435
    232-23-5435 is a valid SSN
    
    Enter a SSN: 23-23-5435
    23-23-5435 is an invalid SSN
