### Exercise 4.11 (Decimal to hex) Write a program that prompts the user to enter an integer between 0 and 15 and displays its corresponding hex number. For an incorrect input number, display invalid input. Here are some sample runs: 

    Enter a decimal value (0 to 15): 11
    The hex value is B
    
    Enter a decimal value (0 to 15): 5
    The hex value is 5
    
    Enter a decimal value (0 to 15): 31
    31 is an invalid input
