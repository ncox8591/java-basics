### Exercise 4.4 (Geometry: area of a hexagon) The area of a hexagon can be computed using the following formula (s is the length of a side):

                 6 x s²
    Area = ------------------
              4 x tan(π/6)
Write a program that prompts the user to enter the side of a hexagon and displays its area. Here is a sample run:

    Enter the side: 5.5
    The area of the hexagon is 78.59
