### Exercise 4.13 (Vowel or consonant?) Write a program that prompts the user to enter a letter and check whether the letter is a vowel or consonant. For nonletter input, display invalid input. Here is a sample run,

    Enter a letter: B
    B is a consonant
    
    Enter a letter: a
    a is a vowel
    
    Enter a letter: #
    # is an invalid input
