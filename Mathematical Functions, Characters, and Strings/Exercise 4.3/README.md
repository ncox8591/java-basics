### Exercise 4.3 (Geography: estimate areas) Use the GPS locations for Atlanta, Georgia; Orlando, Florida; Savannah, Georgia; and Charlotte, North Carolina to compute the estimated area enclosed by these four cities.
(*Hint*: Use the <a href="https://github.com/ncox8591/java-basics/tree/main/Mathematical%20Functions%2C%20Characters%2C%20and%20Strings/Exercise%204.2">formula in 4.2</a> to compute the distance between two cities. Divide the polygon into two triangles and use the formula in <a href="https://github.com/ncox8591/java-basics/tree/main/Elementary%20Programming/Exercise%202.19">Programming Exercise 2.19</a> to compute the area of a triangle.)
