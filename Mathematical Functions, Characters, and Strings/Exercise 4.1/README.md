### Exercise 4.1 (Geometry: area of a pentagon) Write a program that prompts the user to enter the length from the center of a pentagon to a vertex and computes the area of the pentagon.
The formula for computer the area of a pentagon is 
              
                5 x s^2
    Area = ------------------       s is the length of a side = 2r sin(π/5)
              4 x tan(π/5)          r is the length from the center of the pentagon to a vertex
Round up two digits after the decimal point. Here is a sample run,
    
    Enter the length from the center to a vertex: 5.5
    The area of the pentagon is 71.92
